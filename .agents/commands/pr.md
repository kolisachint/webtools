  Open a release PR: create a branch, stage only your changes, rebase on
  origin/main, push, and open a PR labeled cargo:<bump> so the release
  workflow publishes on merge.
  Usage: /pr <patch|minor|major>
argument-hint: patch|minor|major
---
Open a release PR with bump type: **$1** (default to `patch` if empty or invalid).

Goal: get only the changes YOU made in this session onto a feature branch,
rebased on top of `origin/main`, then open a PR labeled `cargo:$1`. When that PR
is merged, `.github/workflows/release.yml` bumps the Cargo.toml version,
tags, and publishes the release binaries.

Follow these steps exactly. Stop and report if any step fails.

1. Resolve the bump type:
   - Use `$1`. If it is not one of `patch`, `minor`, or `major`, use `patch`.

2. Identify ONLY the files you changed in this session. Do NOT use
   `git add -A` or `git add .` (other agents may have uncommitted work in this
   worktree). List the specific paths you created, modified, or deleted.
   Confirm with `git status` that those are the files you intend to stage.

3. Sync with main before branching:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   ```
   Determine if local `main` (or your base) is behind `origin/main`. If behind,
   you must rebase your work onto `origin/main` later (step 6). Do not run
   `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean`, or `git stash` — those can
   destroy other agents' uncommitted work.

4. Create a feature branch from the current state (named for the work, e.g.
   `pr/<short-slug>`):
   ```bash
   git switch -c pr/<short-slug>
   ```

5. Stage ONLY your files and commit:
   ```bash
   git add -- <your-file-1> <your-file-2> ...
   git commit -m "<concise, descriptive message>"
   ```
   Include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the commit body if there
   is a related issue or PR.

6. Run cargo checks to ensure code quality:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all --check
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
   cargo test --workspace
   ```

7. Rebase your branch onto the latest `origin/main`:
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
   Resolve conflicts only in YOUR files. If a conflict appears in a file you did
   not modify, run `git rebase --abort` and stop and ask the user. Never force
   push over shared history beyond your own branch.

8. Push the branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin pr/<short-slug>
   ```

9. Open the PR with a body summarizing the changes (commit messages, affected
   crates, and any `fixes #N` references), and apply the bump label:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "<title>" --body-file <tmp-body.md> --label "cargo:$1"
   ```
   Add relevant labels for the crates you touched.

10. Report the PR URL and the applied `cargo:$1` label.

On merge, the labeled PR triggers the release workflow which bumps the version
in Cargo.toml, updates the lockfile, creates a git tag, and publishes release
binaries — so do not run the release process yourself here.
